# Multiplayer FPS Project - Godot 4.3 (C#)
Welcome to the **Multiplayer FPS** project! This is my first ever attempt at building a 3D FPS controller from scratch using **C#** in **Godot 4.3**. It’s been a wild ride—filled with janky, spaghetti code and plenty of trial and error—but the experience was invaluable.

## About the Project
I embarked on this project with the goal of enhancing my skills in game development and learning C#. Prior to this, my coding experience primarily revolved around solving algorithmic problems on LeetCode and creating complex data structures like virtual heaps using C++. This project was a big leap from that, as I transitioned from pure programming challenges to designing a fully-fledged game.

While the code lacks structure and could use some serious refactoring, getting the project to work has been an accomplishment in itself. I also dove into networking, learning to implement **RPC** calls in Godot, which significantly boosted my understanding of multiplayer game development. I also learned a lot about modularity which I have never thought about before. I was able to build nodes that were transferable all over the game, from character **State-Machines** to weapon info code, and much more.

This project may not have a future, but the knowledge I’ve gained from it will be essential as I move forward to other projects—whether they will continue being game development projects in Godot, Unity, or Unreal Engine, or continue on my Software Development journey.

## Lessons Learned
This project was primarily focused on learning the basics of C# and game design. While the code isn't perfect and the game is far from polished, the experience has been incredibly educational. I now have a deeper understanding of networking, multiplayer systems, and game mechanics—skills I will carry into future projects.
